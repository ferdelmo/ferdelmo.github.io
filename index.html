              I started my professional career doing a couple of internships, firstly I work at the Universidad de Zaragoza while finishing my degree, where I helped to build and update services to improve students' interactions with the university, for things like requesting titles, sending documents, etc. After finishing my degree, I spend a year working on a continuation of my final degree project related to image processing and polarization photos. That paper ended up being presented to the Spanish Congress of Computer Graphics(CEIG2019), and actually winning the best paper of the congress award. After that, I decided to continue my education, and I moved to Madrid to study a master degree in videogame development. During that master, I had the opportunity to contribute to my first videogame, which me and other students from different disciplines. We presented to the PlayStation Talents program. During the master, I worked for a couple of months at Padaone Games (I was hired to stay there for half a year, but it was cut short due to the COVID pandemic). Although the time there was brief, it was the first time that I work on a professional product, helping to build mobile games targeted for kids to explore museums in real life. When I finish my Master, I had the opportunity to join EA Sports Madrid for a one-year internship, and in the end, I was offered a permanent position. Since then I've been working at EA Sports, building AAA videogames for its millions of users. After 3 years of work, I reach an important milestone in my career, which was the release of my first professional videogame, which I was working on from the earlier stage of the project to its launch.

          <h3 class="portfolio-title">EA Sports PGA Tour</h3>
          <p>This is the first professional project that I've worked on. For three years, I worked on EA Sports Madrid to develop this AAA game. I had the opportunity to work in the Modes area, where our work is to build different game modes. Usually, this involved being the nexus between various disciplines to provide them with the needed data or logic. For example, building components and creating RPCs in our servers and entities in the game client to provide UI with the user-created avatar and progress, or creating entities to handle the golfers' turns and score for Tech Designers to build the full gameplay flow. This helped me to develop great communication skills, as I had to work with multiple people from different backgrounds, having to understand the necessities and problems of different disciplines. I had the opportunity to work on multiple areas during the development
          <ul>
            <li>I worked on some of the basic systems for the gameplay flow, like the scorecard (what is used in golf to track each golfer's score) and the different golf game mode logic, playing a normal stroke game, match play, team-based events,...</li>
            <li>I contributed a lot in the career mode, helping to build an immersive experience by simulating golfers' scores and stats taking into account the different difficulties, simulating leaderboards for the different tournaments, building the requirement system to qualify in the different tournaments, etc.</li>
            <li>I help to build a lot of the online systems, like the user avatar progression, the store, the quest system, and the challenges game mode.</li>
            <li>I lead the effort to build the store to purchase items from 1st party (Sony/Microsoft), and I handle the conversations with external partners to do so.</li>
            <li>During the entire development, but especially during the alpha stage of the project, I had a versatile role, not only working in my designated area but also helping other disciplines like UI, Online, or Tech Design to resolve bugs.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="portfolio-title">Polarization Mapping</h3>
          <p>This is a project derived from my end-of-degree project at the Universidad de Zaragoza under the supervision of Adolfo Muñoz. Our work ended up in an investigation paper called Polarization Mapping, which was presented at the Spanish Congress of Computer Graphics(CEIG2019). The research was awarded with the best paper of the conference prize and was published through Computers & Graphics. <a href="http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~amunoz/projects/CG2019_polarization/">Project Page</a></p>
          <p><em>Photographers use the hardware of the camera (aperture, exposure time...), lens and filters as tools for artistic expressivity. This expressivity has often been enhanced by software, such as high dynamic range images have been edited in post-process with software tone mappers. In this paper, we propose a similar approach with polarization filters: we design a capture process that enables us to acquire a Stokes image (that encodes all the possible light polarization states) with a single camera, and we then offer a set of software tools that can apply any common polarization filter as a software post-process, delaying the choice of the adequate filter and enabling filters that can be mathematically modeled but are not available as hardware. Then, we devise and provide new algorithms that automatically select the optimal filter for specific goals, such as maximizing (or minimizing) brightness, contrast or saturation. We later show how such optimization filters can not only be applied to the whole image, but can also be at per-pixel level, obtaining new interesting effects. Such optimization can work at real time rates, fact that is illustrated with a brush based user editing interactive tool. The different types of filters are tested in a wide range of results.</em></p>

          <p>This is my master's degree final project that was developed together with a team of students from different areas. It was built with Unreal Engine 4. The project was my first chance to work in a multidisciplinary team, working with people from art, design, marketing, and other programmers. The game is a third-person platformer, in which you have different abilities to control time. I had the opportunity to work on multiple features of the game, highlighting:
          <li>The custom movement system of the player character.</li>
          <li>Building the pathfinder, path following, and AI algorithms of different enemies</li>
          <li>The camera system, including the third-person camera and the camera transition system to build cinematics.</li>
          <li>The different abilities of the character, that can slow time and reverse it.</li>
          The game was presented to the PlayStation Talents program.</p>

          <h3 class="portfolio-title">Chess Thing</h3>
          <p>Chess Thing is a game made for the 2-Buttons Game Jam 2019 which has the restriction that the game needs to be played and used with only 2 buttons. In the game, you control a pawn in an infinity chess board who had to advance avoiding the other pieces that will attack you. You have a limited time to do a move, which can be: stay still, advance one square, or advance two. With this limited movement, you have to advance all the squares that you can without being captured.</p>
          <p>One interesting thing built, taking into account the limited time of development (4 days) is the AI, which has three different difficulties, limiting the number of moves the AI can do, controlling how many of the positions that the player can go will be threatened.</p>

          <p>This is my personal project of doing a videogame engine from scratch using Vulkan as graphics API. During it, I learned the basics of graphics API and I build a basic engine able to render 3d meshes with shadows and basic shading, using technics like normal mapping or shadow mapping. On top of that, I build some basic game engine architecture, using gameobject-component architecture. Also, basic collision detection was added with sphere and box colliders.</p>
